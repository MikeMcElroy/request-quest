Did I mention that browsers do stuff differently from each other? I think I did.

So, here the `<div>` isn't rendered, but it needs to have its style calculated in order to discover that. Turns out IE, Chrome & Safari queue downloads when styles are resolved. You could argue they're jumping the gun a bit here.
