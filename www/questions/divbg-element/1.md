Yes, CSS background images differ from `img` elements, they aren't downloaded as soon as the element is parsed.

If an element has `display: none`, calculating styles for child elements is a waste of time as they have no impact on the rendering of the document, so background images on child elements are never calculated and therefore not downloaded.
