Yes, CSS background images differ from `img` elements, they aren't downloaded as soon as the element is parsed.

If an element has `display: none`, calculating styles within that element is a waste of time since have no impact on the rendering of the document (they're not displayed), so background images on child elements are never calculated and therefore not downloaded.
