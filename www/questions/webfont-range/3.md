Chrome is arguably a little better optimised.

I say 'a little', because we've told the browser up-front that `font.woff` only contains lowercase a-z glyphs, so there's an easy optimisation that's being passed up by all browsers.

Previous versions of the spec didn't allow browsers to download fonts unless a glyph from them was needed, this was relaxed in late 2011.
