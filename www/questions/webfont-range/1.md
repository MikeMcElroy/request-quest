From [the spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-face-loading):

> User agents that download all fonts defined in @font-face rules without considering whether those fonts are in fact used within a page are considered non-conformant

This is something IE<9 got wrong, but everyone's sensible now. The browser must "consider" if the fonts are used.

…but 'consider' is such a fluffy word. This next one's a puzzler…
