None of the browsers parse scripts of a type/language they don't recognise, but Firefox & IE _will_ download the file regardless of type.

[The HTML spec](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#script-processing-prepare) instructs browsers to ignore script elements with an unsupported type, so "boo hiss" to the browsers that start downloads here.

Interestingly, [some script preloaders relied on browsers downloading unrecognised script types](http://blog.getify.com/on-script-loaders/) in order to populate the cache, which no longer works.
