Oof, sorry, that was a tricky one.

If an HTML comment is written, the `img` element isn't parsed & therefore shouldn't download. However, some browsers optimise by looking ahead and identifying extra requests to make, reducing the performance impact of elements that block parsing, such as inline scripts. This is known as [speculative parsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Optimizing_Your_Pages_for_Speculative_Parsing).

Firefox and IE continue to parse the document while the script is executing, they pick up the `img` and trigger a request. The script finishes and the speculative parsing work is discarded along with the `img` element, an html comment is created in its place, but the request has already been made.

Chrome also scans ahead while blocked by external scripts, but not in the case of inline scripts.
