Triggering the resize event should cause the page to reload right? No, this is a [spec violation](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#dom-location-reload)!

> When the reload() method is invoked … If the currently executing task is the dispatch of a resize event … abort these steps.

Wut? Well, ancient versions of Netscape and IE had really wonky CSS implementations and failed to adapt correctly to window resizes. It became common practice to work around this by triggering a reload on resize. Unfortunately those sites [still exist and cause problems](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201710). The spec recognises this as an anti-pattern and prevents it.
