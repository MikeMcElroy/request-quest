More spec reading:

> Otherwise, resolve the value of the src attribute, relative to the iframe element.

Riiiight, so that sounds like it should make a request here.

> If there exists an ancestor browsing context whose active document's address, ignoring fragment identifiers, is equal to url, then abort these steps.

Ah, so no, there shouldn't be a request here. Chrome violates this part of the spec. "#" is the same url as the parent window if the fragment identifier is ignored.
