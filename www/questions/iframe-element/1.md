Yeah, well, welcome to iframes.

The [spec is clear](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#process-the-iframe-attributes) about handling iframes without a src:

> if the element has no src attribute specifiedâ€¦ fire a simple event named load at the iframe element.

And that's all. A load event is fired even though nothing is loaded.
