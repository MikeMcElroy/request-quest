Uh huh! No requests here. According to [the spec](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#link-type-stylesheet)…

> The appropriate time to obtain the resource is when the external resource link is created or when its element is inserted into a document, whichever happens last.

…so we wouldn't expect to see a request before the `link` was added to the document.
